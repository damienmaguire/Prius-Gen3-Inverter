# Prius-Gen3-Inverter
Open source logic board to control the Toyota Prius Gen 3 Inverter

PCB Files in DesignSpark PCB 8.1 Format

Based on the Open Source Inverter system designed by Johannes Heubner.


27/11/18 Reverse engineering of the inverter continues. Now have all but two of the fifty pins of the igbt interface connector worked out.


01/12/18 Uploaded design for a simple breakout pcb to allow easier access to the 50 Way JST header used for connecting to the IGBT driver board.


01/03/19 Uploaded PDF of V1 logic board design for Gen 3 inverter / converter. Design on PCB commenced. Full design to be released soon.


06/03/19 : Initial release of V1 logic board design files and Gerbers. Changes likely before prototype ordering. BOM on the way.


12/03/19 : Released final design files. Now gone for pcb prototype build. Standby for fun:)

20/01/20 : Design files released for V2 board. Uses MG2 as inverter and MG1 and boost converter for battery charging. Based on the openinverter system. PCB files in DesignSpark PCB 9 format.
